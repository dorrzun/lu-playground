# LU Playground
A Java project to demonstrate design concepts that budding Java developers can apply in industry and just become more familiar with writing programs that can grow to more than a few files!

## Description
This project does not utilize any common framework and behaves much like any "intro" Java program would.
There are three modules to complete, and each one involves both familiar and unfamiliar concepts, some pertaining to Java itself or software development as a whole.

These assignments are not intended to be gospel or cover all scenarios, but they will (hopefully) help you understand what makes most code
readable and maintainable for years to come. Additionally, my work is (like everyone's) a constant work in progress! Feel free to suggestion revisions/changes to the curriculum

To complete each module, watch the Youtube video
