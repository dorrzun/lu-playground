# LU Playground
A multi-module Java "playground" for Longwood student interns/alumni to demonstrate understanding of key software design principles, while learning some industry techniques and tools!  

## Description
**<ins>This project is divided into multiple modules with various degrees of "scaffolding" for you to complete or design from scratch.</ins>**  

Ideally, you will complete this project feeling much more equipped to work with Java in the industry, or even create projects on your own!  

These assignments are not intended to be gospel or cover all possible bases, but they will hopefully help you understand what can make code readable and maintainable for years to come.  

**<ins>Modules I to III:</ins>** Covers both old/new material, some pertaining to Java itself or software development as a whole  
**<ins>Module IV:</ins>** Demonstrates the high quality "off the shelf" functionality that modern frameworks can offer  
**<ins>Module V:</ins>** Best suited for graduates and/or people with prior significant exposure to Java  

**Youtube tutorials to be included for each Tier (WIP)**  

**Tier I: Playing in the Vault**
- What is Domain Driven Design (DDD)

**Tier II: Making Bank (Accounts)**
- What is Failing Fast and Offensive/Defensive Programming?
- What are Annotations?
- Lombok: Boilerplate Be Gone!
- Polymorphism

**(BONUS) Tier IV: Banking With (Spring) Boot**
- Light intro to the Spring Boot Framework
- RESTful APIs & Best Practices
- Swagger

**(BONUS) Tier V: Java, the Double Shot**
- Lazy Evaluation
- Optionals
- Streams 
- Lambda Functions and "Functional" Iteration
- Switch Expressions (Switch Case's Cooler Twin)

### Dependencies
* This repository uses Gradle to manage its dependencies
* Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine and that the $JAVA_HOME env. variable is set appropriately

## Getting Started
* Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* Install the following [VSCode extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace):
  * "Extension Pack for Java" by Microsoft
  * "Gradle for Java" by Microsoft
  * "Test Runner for Java" by Microsoft
  * (Optional) "Live Share" by Microsoft; allows real-time "Google Docs" style editing with your peers!

### Installing
* To install the project's dependencies, you have multiple options:
  * Under the Explorer tab, (accessed via View > Explorer) navigate to Gradle Projects > tier-one and select "tier-one > tasks > build > build"
    * If it doesn't appear as an option, right click on **tier-one/build.gradle** and select "Show Gradle Tasks"

### Executing program
  * To execute the program, if necessary, navigate to application/run in Gradle's Tasks

### Additional Info
Bear with me, as you might encounter an error or two during setup, depending on how accurate my crash course instructions are :)
