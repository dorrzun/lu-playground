# LU Playground
A Java project to demonstrate design concepts that budding Java developers can apply in industry and just become more familiar with writing programs that can grow to more than a few files!

## Description
This project does not utilize any common framework and behaves much like any "intro" Java program would.
There are three modules to complete, and each one involves both familiar and unfamiliar concepts, some pertaining to Java itself or software development as a whole.

These assignments are not intended to be gospel or cover all scenarios, but they will hopefully help you understand what makes most code
readable and maintainable for years to come.
Additionally, my work is a constant work in progress! Feel free to suggestion revisions/changes to the curriculum!

To complete each module, watch the included Youtube video (coming soon...) 

**Tier I: Playing in the Vault**
    - What is Domain Driven Design (DDD)
    - Dependency Injection/Inversion of Control (IOC)
    - Encapsulation, Separation of Concern and Design By Contract
    - JavaDoc: How to use it and why it's important
    - Unit Testing with JUnit 5

**Tier II: Making Bank (Accounts)**
    - What is Failing Fast?
    - What is a Offensive/Defensive Programming?
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
    - Separation of Concern
    - Validation Libraries & Annotations

**Tier III: Bringing Home The Bankon**
  -Demonstrate the following:
    -Service Oriented Design
    -Complete a business process/workflow from start to finish

### Dependencies
* This repository uses Gradle to manage its dependencies
* Ensure you have Java installed on your machine and your $JAVA_HOME environment variable is set appropriately

## Getting Started
* Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* Install the following [VSCode extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace):
  * "Extension Pack for Java" by Microsoft
  * "Gradle for Java" by Microsoft
  * "Test Runner for Java" by Microsoft
  * (Optional) "Live Share" by Microsoft; allows real-time "Google Docs" style editing with your peers!

### Installing
* To install the project's dependencies, you have multiple options:
  * Under the Explorer tab, (accessed via View > Explorer) navigate to Gradle Projects > tier-one and select "tier-one > tasks > build > build"
    * If it doesn't appear as an option, right click on **tier-one/build.gradle** and select "Show Gradle Tasks"

### Executing program
  * To execute the program, if necessary, navigate to application/run in Gradle's Tasks

### Additional Info
Bear with me, as you might encounter an error or two during setup, depending on how accurate my crash course instructions are :)
